In this study, BSBolt, Bwa-meth, Bismark-bwt2-e2e, BSMAP, and Walt are used to further investigate their performance on biological interpretation of WGBS data. However, there are CallMethylation and bismark_methylation_extractor, which wrapped up BSBolt and Bismark-bwt2-e2e, to call the methylation level of CpG sites, respectively. 

To benchmark and evaluate calling performance of methylation level at CpG sites, we use Methyldackel to call the methylation level of CpG sites. 

Sincerely, it is sensible to choose CallMethylation for BSBolt and bismark_methylation_extractor for Bismark to call the methylation level of CpG sites.

This is the README.txt file for the scripts of the manuscript "Benchmarking DNA methylation analysis of 14 Alignment Algorithms for Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing in mammals".
